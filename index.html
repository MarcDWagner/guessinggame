         <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>I live in and grew up in Arizona. I spent 14 years in the US Army as an airborne infantryman, stationed on 3 continents, 4 countries, and 5 states. I was retired 2 years ago, and spent 2 years in the construction industry as a tester & inspector. I studied interdisciplinary studies at Arizona State University with concentrations in political science and history. I try to be as active as my body will let me, I recently started scuba diving, I will be open water certified after a couple trips to lake Pleasant. I also enjoy wood working and cars. I'm married with 2 children.
